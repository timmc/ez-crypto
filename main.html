<h1>Personal cryptography can be easy!</h1>

<p>
All you need is a keypair and some friends who will humor you.
</p>

<p>
[Sidebar: PGP is a commercial product;
GPG is a free-licensed product that is compatible with it.]
</p>

<p>
You'll probably even be able to use the same programs
you always have!
Just look for "PGP" (or "GPG") support.
If your browser or mail client doesn't support them natively,
there's almost always an extension or add-on you can install.
Even without that, *anything that supports plain text*
will support PGP.
</p>

<p>Here's what we're going to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generate a keypair</li>
  <li>Give it to your friends</li>
  <li>Sign your friends' keys</li>
  <li>Start signing and encrypting messages</li>
</ol>

<h2>Let's get you set up with a keypair</h2>

<p>
[Sidebar: A "keypair" is a pair of files, one containing a private key
and one containing a public key.
You keep the private key secret
and share the public key with everyone who wants to communicate with you.]
</p>

<h3>What you'll need</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>A kickass passphrase</b>:
    This is like a password, only more serious
    and *not used anywhere else*.
    My recommendation is to hammer on the keyboard a bit, hitting shift
    occasionally, then write that down on a piece of paper.
    20-30 characters is a good length, as long as you stay away
    from dictionary words and numbers that other people might guess.
    Burn the paper once you're sure you've memorized the password.
    (You could also hide it in the woods or something, I guess.) [1]

    [1] What's your threat model? If you're more concerned about losing the
    passphrase than you are about the government getting a search warrant,
    then putting it in your safe-deposit box might be reasonable.
  </li>
  <li><b>A local app</b> that will generate the keypair for you.
    *Never rely on a web site to do this for you.*
    Your keys *must* be generated and stored on hardware you control.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>
The program will ask you some questions. Here's a cheat-sheet.
</p>

<h4>User ID</h4>

<p>
In PGP-land, keys have a "user ID" --
just a piece of information identifying who owns the key.
A key can have more than one of these.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>"Full name"</dt>
  <dd>Something that is reasonably appropriate for identifying you.
    This doesn't need to be your legal name!
    For some people, and for some uses, that's
    "Alfred Wilhelm Uppington III".
    If you're a world-famous programmer or a superhero,
    it might be "_why" or "Batman" or some other pseudonym.
    In any event, keep it professional and useful.
  </dd>
  <dt>Email address</dt>
  <dd>When people send you encrypted mail with this key,
    what email address should they use? This one!
    This field helps other people's email programs
    find <em>your</em> public key.
    If you don't want your email ending up in the hands of spammers,
    don't send your key to a public keyserver
    (but the spammers probably already have your address anyway.)  
  </dd>
  <dt>Comment</dt>
  <dd>Up to you! I use this for describing the purpose
    of the email address, e.g. "work topics only".
  </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Crypto crap</h4>

<p>
When you're asked for an encryption method and a key size,
pick RSA (or DSA + Elgamal)
and the biggest number available (probably 4096).
Bigger key sizes will be stronger,
but can be a little bulkier or take a little longer to use.
</p>

<p>
Set the key to never expire.
</p>

### What to expect

<p>
You'll be asked for a user ID,
and then for your awesome, complicated passphrase,
and then you'll wait for a minute or two
while your computer gathers enough randomness
to construct a really good keypair for you.
</p>

<p>
Don't just sit there and stare at the progress bar;
use your computer as usual.
It uses your keyboard and mouse activity
to help it generate good random numbers.
</p>

<h3>Pick an app</h3>

<h4>Linux: Seahorse</h4>

<p>
If you use Ubuntu Linux (a very common distro),
you should already have Seahorse installed.
Find it under `Preferences -> Passwords and Keys`.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make a new key: `File -> New... -> PGP Key`</li>
  <li>Export your public key: `File -> Export...`
    and make sure to select "Armored PGP Keys" from the dropdown.
    [glossary item]</li>
  <li>Email that to your friends! [Footnote: They can't trust it's yours,
    but this is a way of getting it to them without
    exposing your email address to spammers.]</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pitfalls</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have "also encrypt to self" turned on
    when encrypting messages to other people,
    otherwise you won't be able to read what you sent!
  </li>
  <li>Many email programs can't search inside encrypted messages.</li>
</ul>
