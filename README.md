# EZ crypto: Cryptography should be easy!

This is a guide (in development) for easy, practical crypto --
I want a complete newbie to be able to get up and running
with a new keypair and various apps in just an hour or so
(and without being intimidated.)

My plan is to publish it as a sub-site on brainonfire.net.

Pull requests welcome, but check with me first before doing a lot of work.
