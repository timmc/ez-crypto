<h1>A good passphrase is important</h1>

<p>
A passphrase is just a password on steroids.
The password you use for some random website
that you don't care about very much might look like
<s>paramount5</s> or <s>^not&amp;secure</s> —
something very simple with a couple of numbers
or punctuation symbols
carelessly tossed in.
A well-written cracking program could guess those in a few minutes!
A passphrase, on the other hand, is expected to be <strong>strong</strong>.
It's best to generate them randomly and then figure out mnemonics
that will help you remember them.
Good passphrases look like
<u><code>3AhWv4'Q#5h2IM1Gt</code></u>
or
<u><code>felnroth LKKrl pi[toacl</code></u>
or
<u><code>xrategic(level of the Quadrenni9l De%ense Review (QDR) 2006 goals</code></u>.
</p>

<p>
The more like normal text they look, the longer they should be.
</p>

<h2>How am I supposed to memorize that?</h2>

<p>
In the general case, the more secure a passphrase is against attack,
the harder it will be to memorize.
This is because advanced passphrase-cracking programs
are written to prioritize guesses that people would find memorable.
There are two tricks I will recommend to combat this unfortunate tension:
</p>

<h3>Write it down</h3>

     alt="It's easier to remember something you've seen on paper a few times">

<p>
While passphrases on paper are less secure
if someone is targeting you (e.g. stalker, police),
they're fine as a temporary measure
until you succeed in memorizing the passphrase —
and perfectly fine if you're only worried about digital snooping.
Tips for this strategy:
</p>

<ul>
<!--li>Make sure there isn't anything soft
  under the paper you're writing on;
  a thousand and one detective novels
  involve someone reading the impressions left behind on a pad of paper. :-)
</li-->
<li>When you have it memorized, store the passphrase somewhere safe.
  This might be your safe deposit box or in a jar buried in the woods.
</li>
<li>Don't write down what it's <em>for</em> on the piece of paper,
  unless you're OK with the finder knowing.
  This may sound obvious, but it's worth mentioning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Take an odd sentence and then distort it</h3>

<p>
"Odd" here just means a sentence that most people
would find opaque, hard to understand, or technical.
Use uncommon words like gneiss, proprioceptive, or infundibulum.
Using another language is great, but don't pick a well-known phrase.
This is a good way of generating something
that an automated password cracker
is unlikely to guess,
since they prioritize more common words.
</p>

<p>
Then, distort the sentence by inserting, changing, or deleting
random characters at random locations.
(It's best to rely on a random number generator for this,
since humans are notoriously bad at being unpredictable.)
You'll be able to remember these few alterations much more effectively
than a whole sentence full of random characters.
The result is a pretty effective passphrase!
